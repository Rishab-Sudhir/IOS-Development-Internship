#Projects That i have worked on while on my IOS internship. I also included some of the projects i did while learning IOS development 
before the internship

The biggest project i did was the BU AKPSI App which is an app that pulls data from a firebase realtime database that is intergrated
with a google sheets. It then presents this information in a scrolling format, where each item can be click and expanded.
It also includes a google sign in authorization module which only allows people from BU and AKPSI (an organization) to access the 
data.
